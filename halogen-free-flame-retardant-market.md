<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Halogen-Free Flame Retardant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Aluminum Hydroxide</li><li>Organo-Phosphorus</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Halogen-Free Flame Retardant market consists of two main types: Aluminum Hydroxide and Organo-Phosphorus. Aluminum Hydroxide is a non-toxic and environmentally friendly flame retardant widely used in various applications due to its ability to release water at high temperatures, thus cooling down the material and preventing the spread of fire. On the other hand, Organo-Phosphorus compounds work by forming a protective char layer when exposed to flame, which acts as a barrier and prevents further combustion. Both types are popular choices for manufacturers looking to meet fire safety regulations without using halogenated chemicals.</p></p>
