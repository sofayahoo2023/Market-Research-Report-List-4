<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Iron Oxide Target Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plane Target</li><li>Rotating Target</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The iron oxide target market can be categorized into two main types: plane target and rotating target. Plane targets are fixed in place during the deposition process and are commonly used for sputtering applications where a uniform film thickness is desired. Rotating targets, on the other hand, spin during the deposition process, allowing for more even erosion and longer target life. Both types serve different purposes in the industry and cater to various requirements of the users.</p></p>
