<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Three Phase SCR Power Controller Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Phase Angle Control</li><li>Integral Cycle Switching</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Phase angle control and integral cycle switching are two types of control methods used in Three Phase SCR Power Controllers. Phase angle control is characterized by the ability to vary the firing angle of the SCRs to regulate power output continuously. Integral cycle switching, on the other hand, involves turning the SCRs on for a fixed number of cycles to regulate power output in discrete steps. Both methods have their own advantages and applications based on the specific requirements of the system being controlled.</p></p>
