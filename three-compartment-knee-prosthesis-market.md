<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Three compartment Knee Prosthesis Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cemented Bone</li><li>Non-Cemented Bone</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cemented bone knee prostheses utilize a special bone cement to secure the implant in place, providing immediate stability. This type of prosthesis is commonly used in older patients with weaker bone density. Non-cemented bone knee prostheses rely on the natural bone to grow and adhere to the implant over time, providing long-term stability. This type is often preferred for younger, more active patients as it allows for more natural bone preservation and potential for future revisions.</p></p>
