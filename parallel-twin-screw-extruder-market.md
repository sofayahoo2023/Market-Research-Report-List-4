<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Parallel Twin Screw Extruder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Co-rotating</li><li>Counter-rotating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Co-rotating and counter-rotating are two types of parallel twin-screw extruders used in the market. Co-rotating extruders have two screws that rotate in the same direction, generating high levels of shear and mixing within the barrel. This type is suitable for high viscosity materials. Counter-rotating extruders have two screws that rotate in opposite directions, providing better self-wiping and conveying properties. They are ideal for processing heat-sensitive and fragile materials. Both types offer unique advantages and are used in different industries based on material requirements.</p></p>
