<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Unlead Solder Paste & Flux Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solder Paste</li><li>Flux</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solder paste is a type of material used in the electronics industry for joining surface mount components to printed circuit boards. It consists of tiny solder particles mixed with flux, which helps to clean and prepare the surfaces for soldering. Flux is a chemical cleaning agent that removes oxides from the metal surfaces to allow the solder to flow and bond properly. These two materials are essential for achieving strong and reliable solder joints in electronic assemblies.</p></p>
