<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Open-end Spinning Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-venting Type</li><li>Pumping Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Open-end spinning machines are classified into two types: self-venting type and pumping type. In self-venting type machines, the fibers are drawn into the machine by creating negative pressure which allows for continuous spinning. On the other hand, pumping type machines use a pump to suck the fibers into the machine, ensuring a smooth spinning process. Both types of machines are widely used in the textile industry for their efficiency and effectiveness in producing high-quality yarn.</p></p>
