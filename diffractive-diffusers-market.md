<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diffractive Diffusers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Round</li><li>Square</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Diffractive diffusers come in two main market types: round and square. Round diffractive diffusers are circular in shape and are commonly used in applications where a uniform distribution of light is required, such as in photography and lighting fixtures. Square diffractive diffusers, on the other hand, are more commonly used in displays and projection systems where a square pattern of light is needed. Both types of diffractive diffusers work by scattering incoming light to create a more even distribution of light output.</p></p>
