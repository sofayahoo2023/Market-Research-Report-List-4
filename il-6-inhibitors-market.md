<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The IL-6 Inhibitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>IL-6 Receptors Antagonistic Anitibody</li><li>Antibody against IL-6</li></ul></p>
<p><p>IL-6 inhibitors are a type of medication that work by blocking the activity of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a protein involved in inflammation and immune response. There are two main types of IL-6 inhibitors on the market: IL-6 receptor antagonistic antibodies and antibodies against IL-6 itself. IL-6 receptor antagonistic antibodies bind to the receptors on cells, preventing IL-6 from signaling. Antibodies against IL-6 directly target and neutralize the IL-6 protein, reducing inflammation and symptoms of conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease.</p></p>
