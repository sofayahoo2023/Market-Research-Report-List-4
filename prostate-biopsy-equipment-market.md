<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Prostate Biopsy Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>TRUS (trans-rectal ultrasound)</li><li>TPBX (trans-perineal)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Prostate Biopsy Equipment Market includes two main types of procedures - TRUS (trans-rectal ultrasound) and TPBX (trans-perineal). TRUS involves using ultrasound guidance to target specific areas of the prostate for biopsy, while TPBX involves inserting a needle through the perineum to access the prostate. Both procedures are commonly used to diagnose and monitor prostate cancer. The choice between TRUS and TPBX often depends on the patient's specific condition and the preference of the healthcare provider.</p></p>
