<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gas Scrubber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Type I</li><li>Type II</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gas scrubbers are commonly classified into two types based on their operating principle and design. Type I gas scrubbers utilize a wet scrubbing process where contaminants are removed from the gas stream through contact with a liquid absorbent. This type is effective for removing soluble gases and particulates. Type II gas scrubbers, on the other hand, operate through a dry scrubbing process using adsorbents to capture contaminants. These scrubbers are more suitable for removing odors and gases that are not easily soluble in liquid absorbents.</p></p>
