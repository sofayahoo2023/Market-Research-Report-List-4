<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pressure Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Postive Pressure</li><li>Negative Pressure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Positive Pressure Ventilators apply pressure to the airway to push air into the lungs, aiding in inflation. These ventilators are commonly used in hospital settings for patients who are unable to breathe on their own. Negative Pressure Ventilators, on the other hand, create a vacuum around the chest to expand the lungs and draw air in. Negative pressure ventilators are often used in home settings for patients with chronic respiratory conditions. Both types of ventilators help to support breathing and oxygenation in patients with respiratory issues.</p></p>
