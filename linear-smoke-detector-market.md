<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Linear Smoke Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reflective</li><li>End to End</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Linear smoke detectors are commonly classified into two main types: reflective and end-to-end. Reflective linear smoke detectors use a single unit to emit and receive infrared light, with the smoke particles scattering the light and allowing the detector to sense the presence of smoke. End-to-end linear smoke detectors use two separate units placed at a distance from each other, with one unit emitting the light and the other receiving it. Both types are effective in detecting smoke and providing early warning in case of a fire.</p></p>
