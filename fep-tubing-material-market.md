<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The FEP Tubing Material Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heat Shrinkable Tubing</li><li>Extruded Tubing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The FEP tubing material market consists of two main types: heat shrinkable tubing and extruded tubing. Heat shrinkable tubing is designed to shrink in diameter when heat is applied, providing a tight and secure fit around wires or cables. Extruded tubing, on the other hand, is formed by pushing the FEP material through a die to create a specific shape or size. Both types of tubing are commonly used in industries such as electronics, automotive, and medical devices for insulation and protection purposes.</p></p>
