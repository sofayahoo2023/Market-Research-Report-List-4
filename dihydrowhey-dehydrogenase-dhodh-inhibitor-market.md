<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dihydrowhey Dehydrogenase (DHODH) Inhibitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Brequinar Protein Analogue</li><li>Inorganic Small Molecule Compounds</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibitors can be classified into two main types, Brequinar Protein Analogue and Inorganic Small Molecule Compounds. Brequinar Protein Analogue inhibitors are structurally similar to the natural substrate of DHODH and competitively inhibit its activity. On the other hand, Inorganic Small Molecule Compounds act by binding to the enzyme and interfering with its function. Both types of inhibitors are being studied for their potential therapeutic applications in various diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Dihydrowhey Dehydrogenase (DHODH) Inhibitor Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL) Treatment</li><li>Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Treatment</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibitors have shown promising results in the treatment of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). These inhibitors work by targeting the enzyme DHODH, which is essential for pyrimidine biosynthesis in rapidly dividing cancer cells. By inhibiting this enzyme, DHODH inhibitors disrupt the cancer cell's ability to replicate, ultimately leading to cell death. This makes DHODH inhibitors a valuable treatment option for patients with APL and AML.</p></p>
