<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Diamond Core Drilling Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Type</li><li>Dry Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electric diamond core drilling machines come in two main types: wet type and dry type. Wet type machines use water to cool the diamond bit during the drilling process, reducing heat and extending the life of the bit. This type is commonly used for drilling into harder materials like concrete and stone. Dry type machines, on the other hand, do not require water and are typically used for drilling into softer materials like wood and plastic. Both types have their own advantages and are chosen based on the specific drilling requirements.</p></p>
