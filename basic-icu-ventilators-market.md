<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Basic ICU Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilation</li><li>Non-invasive Ventilation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Basic ICU ventilators are categorized into two main types - invasive ventilation and non-invasive ventilation. Invasive ventilation involves the use of a tube inserted into the patient's airway to deliver oxygen and remove carbon dioxide. It is typically used for patients with severe respiratory failure. Non-invasive ventilation, on the other hand, delivers oxygen through a mask or nasal prongs and is used for patients who can breathe on their own but need assistance. Both types of ventilators play a crucial role in providing respiratory support to critically ill patients in the ICU.</p></p>
