<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water Mist Fire Extinguishing System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Pressure Water Mist System</li><li>Low Pressure Water Mist System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Water mist fire extinguishing systems are classified into two main types - high pressure water mist systems and low pressure water mist systems. High pressure water mist systems operate at pressures above 35 bar, creating a fine mist that suppresses fires by cooling and displacing oxygen. Low pressure water mist systems, on the other hand, operate at pressures below 35 bar and use larger droplets to achieve similar suppression effects. Both systems are effective in extinguishing fires in various settings, but their application depends on the specific requirements of the environment.</p></p>
