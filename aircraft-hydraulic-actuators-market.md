<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Hydraulic Actuators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Acting Drive</li><li>Double Acting Drive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aircraft hydraulic actuators come in two main types: single-acting drive and double-acting drive. Single-acting drive actuators use hydraulic pressure to move in one direction, either extending or retracting as needed. On the other hand, double-acting drive actuators can move in both directions, extending and retracting based on the hydraulic pressure applied. Both types play a crucial role in controlling various aircraft systems, such as landing gear, flaps, and thrust reversers, ensuring the smooth operation and safety of the aircraft.</p></p>
